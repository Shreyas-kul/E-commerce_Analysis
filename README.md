Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce transaction data to generate business insights, build a lookalike recommendation model, and perform customer segmentation. The analysis helps understand customer behavior, product performance, and patterns in transaction data for actionable decision-making.
Features
1)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):Analyzed customer signup trends, regional distributions, and product price categories.
Derived sales trends, top-performing customers/products, and seasonal patterns.

2)Lookalike Recommendation Model:Recommended top 3 similar customers for a given customer based on transaction history and customer profiles.
Assigned similarity scores using advanced similarity metrics.

3)Customer Segmentation:Segmented customers using clustering techniques like KMeans.
Evaluated clusters with Davies-Bouldin Index and visualized using scatter plots.

Dataset Details
.)Customers.csv: Customer information (e.g., name, region, signup date).
.)Products.csv: Product details (e.g., name, category, price).
.)Transactions.csv: Transaction history (e.g., customer, product, quantity, value).

Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook
Git for version control
